## Python - More Data Structures: Set Dictionary

### Description
Dictionaries in Python do not allow you to store a series of maps between two sets of items, called keys and values (Keys and Values). All items in the dictionary are enclosed in a pair of square brackets {} .

Sets in Python are a type that allows multiple elements to be stored and accessed in a very similar way to lists, but with certain differences: The elements of a set are unique, which means that there cannot be duplicate elements.
