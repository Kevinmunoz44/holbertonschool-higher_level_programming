## Python - import & modules

### Description
In this project, I learned about importing and using functions and creating modules in Python. I further practiced using the builtin function dir() and using command line arguments within Python programs.

|--------|--------|
|    0-add.py    |    Write a program that imports the function def add(a, b): from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3   |
|    1-calculation.py    |    	Write a program that imports functions from the file calculator_1.py, does some Maths, and prints the result.    |
|    2-args.py    |    Write a program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments.    |
|    3-infinite_add.py    |    Write a program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments    |
|    4-hidden_discovery.py    |    Write a program that prints all the names defined by the compiled module (curl -Lso "hidden_4.pyc") hidden_4.pyc (please download it locally).    |
